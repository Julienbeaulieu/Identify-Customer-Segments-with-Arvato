# Identify Customer Segments with Arvato

## Overview 
In this project, Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Financial Solutions have provided two datasets. One with demographic information about the people of Germany, and one with that same information for customers of a mail-order sales company. I have looked at relationships between demographics features, organized the population into clusters, and saw how prevalent customers are in each of the segments obtained.

This project was completed as part of Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree certification.

## Objective
Our main question of interest is to identify facets of the population that are most likely to be purchasers of the company's products for a mailout campaign. Our job is to use unsupervised learning techniques to organize the general population into clusters, then use those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company. Prior to applying the machine learning methods, we also assessed and cleaned the data in order to convert the data into a usable form.
